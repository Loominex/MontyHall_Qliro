The Monty Hall problem comes from a popular tv shows that confused people for decades. 
In the game show, Let's Make a Deal, Monty Hall asks you to guess which closed door a prize is behind. The answer is 
so puzzling that people often refuse to accept it! 

In this program, I simulated the game by a simple windows-form application that processes more than 100,000,000 simulations 
in less than 15 seconds (of course it also depends on your system) using batch process and multi threading.
